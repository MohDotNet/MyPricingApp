# MyPricingApp

## Overview
Simple pricing App allows business owners to see profit, tax obligation and establish feasibility of carrying said product.
Initially this app was intended to be my playground for learning JetPack Compose and Kotlin.
However as i started writing the app i figured people could use and or benifit from this app.

## Technologies
I used Kotlin as the programming Language and JetPack Compose to do the UI.
At the time of writing this the aim is for this app to run on the Android Platform, specifically on a tablet device.
It could work on a standard 6 inch cellphone how ever that was not the intention.

## Invitation
If you a developer starting out with Kotlin and JetPack, please feel free to keep in touch let's see how we can grow this app and better hte code.
By no means is this perfect, i will be continuously Updating it.
My next steps are to clean the code a bit, experiment with added a design pattern, etc.

## Context
This app was written in the South African Context.
So Tax will be calculated at the current rate of 15% if one is registered as a vat vendor.
